      Excerpt from "Strength to Love" by Martin Luther King Jr.

      In a real sense, all life is interrelated. All men are caught
      in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment
      of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all
      indirectly. I can never be what I ought to be until you are what
      you ought to be, and you can never be what you ought to be until
      I am what I ought to be. This is the interrelated structure of
      reality.
      The rich man tragically failed to realize this. He thought he could
      live and grow in his own little self-centered world. He was an
      individualist gone wild. Indeed, he was an eternal fool!
