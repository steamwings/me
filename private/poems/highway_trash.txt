How dare you taint our noble pathways
Our breathtaking transcontinental networks
The silver carpets for shining, manicured steeds
Why do you litter the lanes?

How reckless to crowd the shallow margins
How disgraceful to abstain from glorious personal transportation
I guess you wasted all your money, or drove drunk
You must deserve the gutter's grime

I tried it today.
It took hours to walk
By the rushing, rattling beasts

A butterfly greeted me
When I boldly claimed the right turn lane
Since the alternative was briar

And I didn't see much trash
I felt the hot, cold, long nights
With few, lonely signs and lights
Through a wasteland paved by antipathy
