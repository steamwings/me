How dare you taint our noble pathways
Our breathtaking transcontinental networks
The silver carpets for shining, manicured steeds
Why do you litter the lanes?

How reckless to crowd the shallow margins
I guess you wasted all your money
Or lost your license driving drunk
How disgraceful to abstain from glorious personal transportation

I tried it today
I took extra time to walk
By the rushing, rattling beasts

A butterfly greeted me
As I walked in the right turn lane
Since there was no sidewalk

And I didn't see much trash
Not when felt the hot, cold, long nights home
When I walked without path or light or sign
Through a landscape paved by antipathy
