It was the violent one
That runs the wrong way and starts fights over food
There's still a mark from when it bit you
As you tried to wrap its wound

It was the stupid one
You turn your back and it runs toward danger
Must have gone straight through the mud
How many times now this week?

It was the hungry one
Though the flock enjoys fresh grass
You're not satisfied with the good of the many
You fence them up before the search

It was the broken one
You remember that sad day
Poor thing fell in a ditch when it was still little
Been shaken up ever since

It was the senseless one
What makes it run back to that place?
Each escapade leads to another
The worse the danger, the better

It was the hurt sheep
That's why you ran--there!
You shout for joy, tenderly rescue
The bleeding, bleating, trapped, exhausted

It would have been easier, practical, sensible, reasonable, justified, logical, rational, ethical
To just cut your losses
The world is left to wonder why
It was the bad one
