To stay or go away?
Only the wind can say
Calculation confounded
In torrents surrounded
Only the storm can rage

To grieve or to hope?
Only the harvest can know
Blossoms tranquility
Awash in futility
Only the clouds can soak

To return or onward trudge?
Only the rivers can judge
Smoothing stones
Or breaking bones
Only my feet can budge
