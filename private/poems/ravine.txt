Betwixt stability and principle
A ravine of realism lies
Standing on tenuous precipice
I most fear the other side

It is not greener or more lovely
As far as I can see
But somehow to forego a leap
Seems the greater tragedy

Is surrender the cost of safety?
Insanity the price of growth?
On some days the gap seems small
Today nearly wider than hope

I should be running far away
Someday I'll wish I had
Instead I'm running for a jump
If I make it, I'll be glad

Wrong--I am more terrified!
Helpless in a new frontier
My consolation is a fool's conviction
I decided; and I'm here

It's a winding and a dangerous road
To nowhere guaranteed
But there's a chance that's well-deserved
That is preserved in me

For while at least I had a choice
The others here did not
Down slippery path, I hear a noise
A prisoner of this rock

The chances often don't look good
That we could both cross back
Will they trust enough to soar?
Is it me they will attack?

I struggle now to recollect
Life on the former side
Dreams of breakfasts and of bridges
Now my dream is to survive

I must prepare to meet my fate
As quick as it may be
But I'm content at any rate
That I've crossed the great ravine

The world won't know me as a hero
Nor see what I have done
Unlikely, yes, but just perhaps
I'll be hero just to one
