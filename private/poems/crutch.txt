Desperately needed, essential
Yet despised, shameful
But here for every agonizing step
Adjusting as you need
Going where you lead
Bearing all your weight
Gently taking a beating
"Really, I am not a weapon!"
(I assure myself, since you cannot hear me)
Holding up fine when thrown across the room
Slowly--my value is acknowledged
Joy is shared and remembered

Then, shortly--I am unprescribed.
Unfit for your future
Unlikely to be recycled
My best hope is the attic
Collecting dust
They say I am best forgotten
Surely--I will never forget
If you were healed (or at least held) then I was made (or at least mad)
My purpose served in all the steps you took
And even if you never look back
I take pride in all the steps you take
I have a small claim to your stride.

Oh dear, legs...
I have watched you stumble
In the end, our work was together
You didn't ask for me
You didn't want me
Yet I have gladly given what you could not
And though I didn't want it to be
This journey was always for you, too.
