Dishwasher, phone call, car horns
Daily cacophony disappears when my ears submerge

The deep drone and harmonic bellows greet me
The slow universe reverberates
The depths of the cosmos remind me of my small place
But the warm encompassment rejects my presence
Terrible powers make my ears throb
"Return!"

Traveling through time and space
I emerge
I welcome the harmless noises
And take a clean towel
