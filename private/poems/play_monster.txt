"Come play monster!"
Child, we are all monsters in our own way
How do I explain?
Perhaps we just resume the game

"You be monster!"
Some days I already am
Schedule-keeping, seldom-feeling
Always wishing I was sleeping

"You monster?"
Sometimes inside, though I hope you don't see
I hope you never learn it from me
Worse if I remind you of those you have seen

"I monster!"
Ha! Truly, it's hard to believe
That one day you might be a monster like me
Perhaps that's why we play pretend
To find the fine line between monster and friend
