Perhaps weakness is a celebration
A suggestion of magnificent sustenance
For even the ephemeral and frail
The short-lived or sickly
Had an invitation to the world
It would be vanity to call their time vain

If all is weak and vain, we are on equal footing
And those of shorter time or smaller might
Are the icons of our plane
The embodiment of our gratitude
The heroes of our kind

If strength is the story of destruction
Then glory in strength is irony
And weakness is a celebration
