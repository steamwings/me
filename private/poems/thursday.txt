Monday starts the week
Blinking, reeling, and keeling
A whole week's ahead!

Plainly a Tuesday
We've forgotten Monday's dreams
Try again next week

Wednesday, the longest
Labor here, ahead, behind
Hard work brings good rest

Thursday, the middle
Life happens here--settle in.
Tomorrow's Friday--

Thank God, glory's edge
Be glad yet revels reveal
Our identity

Wake up, Saturday!
Endless possibility
Or perhaps nothing

Something new starts here
Though often we must restart
Sunday never ends
