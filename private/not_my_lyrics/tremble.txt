Peace, bring it all to peace
The storms surrounding me
Let it break at Your Name

Still, call the sea to still
The rage in me to still
Every wave at Your Name

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus

Breathe, call these bones to live
Call these lungs to sing
Once again, I will praise

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus

Your Name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your Name cannot be overcome
Your Name is alive, forever lifted high
Your Name cannot be overcome

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus

Your Name is a light that the shadows can't deny
Your Name cannot be overcome
Your Name is alive, forever lifted high
Your Name cannot be overcome

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus, You silence fear
Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
