There's nothing worth more
That will ever come close
Nothing can compare
You're our living Hope

I've tasted and seen
Of the sweetest of love
When my heart becomes free
And my shame is undone

Holy Spirit, You are welcome here
Come flood this place
And fill the atmosphere
Your glory God
Is what our hearts long for
To be overcome
By Your presence, Lord

I've tasted and seen
Of the sweetest of love
When my heart becomes free
And my shame is undone

Your presence, Lord
Holy Spirit You are welcome here
Come flood this place
And fill the atmosphere
Your glory God
Is what our hearts long for
To be overcome
By Your presence, Lord

Let us become more aware
Of Your presence
Let us experience the glory
Of Your goodness
