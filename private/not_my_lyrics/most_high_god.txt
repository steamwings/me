All the other gods
They are the works of man
But you are the Most High God
There is none like You

Jehovah you are the most high!
You are the most high God
Jehovah, you are the most high!
You are the most high God

Jehovah ah ah!
Jehovah eh eh!
Jehovah ah ah!
You are the most high God!

Elohim Adonai
Elohim You are the most high God
