Left my fear by the side of the road
Hear You speak, won't let go
Fall to my knees as I lift my hands to pray
Got every reason to be here again
Father's love that draws me in
And all my eyes wanna see is a glimpse of You

All I need is you
All I need is you, Lord
Is you, Lord
All I need is you
All I need is you, Lord
Is you, Lord

One more day and it's not the same
Your Spirit calls my heart to sing
Drawn to the voice of my Saviour once again
Where'd my soul be without your Son?
Who gave His life to save the earth
Rest in the thought that you're watching over me

All I need is you
All I need is you, Lord
Is you, Lord
All I need is you
All I need is you, Lord
Is you, Lord
All I need is you

You hold the universe
You hold everyone on earth
You hold the universe
You hold, yeah you hold
