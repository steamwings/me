There's a voice that cries out in the silence
Searching for a heart that will love Him
Longing for a child that will give Him their all
Give it all, He wants it all

And there's a God that walks over the earth
He's searching for a heart that is desperate
And longing for a child that will give Him their all
Give it all, He wants it all

And He says love me, love me with your whole heart
He wants it all today
Serve Me, serve Me with your life now
He wants it all today
Bow down, let go of your idols
He wants it all today
He wants it all today
He wants it all today
He wants it all

And there's a God that walks over the earth
He's searching for a heart that is desperate
Longing for a child that will give Him their all
Give it all, He wants it all

And he says love me, love me with your whole heart
He wants it all today
Serve Me, serve me with your life now
He wants it all today
Bow down, let go of your idols
He wants it all today
He wants it all today
He wants it all today
He wants all of you

More of you, more of you
He wants it all today, oh oh oh oh
More of you, more of you
He wants it all today, oh oh oh oh
More of you, more of you
He wants it all today, today, today
He wants it all today
He wants it all today
So give it all

There's a voice that cries out in the silence
Searching for a heart that will love Him
Longing for a child that will give Him their all
Give it all
He wants it all
