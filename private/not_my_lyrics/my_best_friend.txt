Have you heard of the One called Savior?
Have you heard of His perfect love?
Have you heard of the One in Heaven?
Have you heard how He gave His Son?

Well I have found this love
And I believe in the Son
Show me Your way

Jesus You are my best friend
And You will always be
Nothing will ever change that

I believe in the One called Savior
I believe He's the Risen One
I believe that I'll live forever
I believe that the King will come

Because I have found this love
And I believe in the Son
Show me Your way

Jesus You are my best friend
And You will always be
Nothing will ever change that

Jesús, mi mejor amigo
Siempre tu serás
Nada podrá cambiarlo
