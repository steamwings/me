I raise a hallelujah
In the presence of my enemies
I raise a hallelujah
Louder than the unbelief
I raise a hallelujah
My weapon is a melody
I raise a hallelujah
Heaven comes to fight for me

I'm gonna sing
In the middle of the storm
Louder and louder
You're gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes
Hope will arise
Death is defeated
The king is alive

I raise a hallelujah
With everything inside of me
I raise a hallelujah
I will watch the darkness flee
I raise a hallelujah
In the middle of the mystery
I raise a hallelujah
Fear you lost your hold on me

I'm gonna sing
In the middle of the storm
Louder and louder
You're gonna hear my praises roar
Up from the ashes
Hope will arise
Death is defeated
The king is alive

I needed rescue
My sin was heavy
But chains break at the weight of Your glory
I needed shelter
I was an orphan
But You call me a citizen of Heaven
When I was broken
You were my healing
Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
I have a future
My eyes are open
Cause when you called my name
I ran out of that grave!

Sing a little louder
(in the presence of my enemies)
Sing a little louder
(louder than the unbelief)
Sing a little louder
(my weapon is a melody)
Sing a little louder
(heaven comes to fight for me)
