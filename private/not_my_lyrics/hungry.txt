Hungry I come to You for I know You satisfy
I am empty but I know Your love does not run dry

So I wait for You
So I wait for You

I'm falling on my knees offering all of me
Jesus You're all this heart is living for

Broken I run to You for Your arms are open wide
I am weary but I know Your touch restores my life

Hambriento vengo a tí porque satisfaces
Estoy vacío pero tu amor nunca se seca

Espero a tí
Espero a tí

Yo caigo de rodillas
Ofrezco lo que tenga
Jésus mi corazón late por tí
