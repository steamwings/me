I need You more
More than yesterday
I need You more
More than words can say
I need You more
Than ever before
I need You, Lord
I need You, Lord

More than the air I breathe
More than the song I sing
More than the next heartbeat
More than anything
And Lord, as time goes by
I'll be by Your side
'Cause I never want to go back to my old life

We give You the highest praise
We give You the highest praise
