Bless the Lord O my soul
O my soul
Worship his holy name
Sing like never before
O my soul
I'll worship your holy name

The sun comes up
It's a new day dawning
It's time to sing your song again
Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me
Let me be singing when the evening comes

Bless the Lord, O my soul
With all that is within me
Bless his holy name
Bless the Lord, O my soul

You're rich in love and you're slow to anger
Your name is great and your heart is kind
For all your goodness I will keep on singing
10, 000 reasons for my heart to find

Bless the Lord, O my soul
With all that is within me
Bless his holy name
Bless the Lord, O my soul

And on that day when my strength is failing
The end draws near and my time has come
Still my soul will sing your praise unending
10, 000 years and then forever more

Bless the Lord, O my soul
With all that is within me
Bless his holy name
Bless the Lord, O my soul
