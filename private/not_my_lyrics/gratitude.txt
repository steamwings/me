All my words fall short
I got nothing new
How could I express
All my gratitude?

I could sing these songs
As I often do
But every song must end
And You never do

So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah

I've got one response
I've got just one move
With my arm stretched wide
I will worship You

So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Come on, my soul
Don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song
Cuz you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord
