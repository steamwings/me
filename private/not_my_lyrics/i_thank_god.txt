Wandering into the night
Wanting a place to hide
This weary soul, this bag of bones

And I tried with all my mind
And I just can't win the fight
I'm slowly drifting, a vagabond

And just when I ran out of road
I met a man I didn't know
And he told me
That I was not alone

He picked me up
Turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
Changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
I thank God

I cannot deny what I see
Got no choice but to believe
My doubts are burning
Like ashes in the wind

So, so long to my old friends
Burden and bitterness
You can just keep it moving
Nah, you ain't welcome here

From now 'til I walk
The streets of gold
I'll sing of how You saved my soul
This wayward son
Has found his way back home

He picked me up
Turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
Changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
I thank God

Hell lost another one
I am free, I am free, I am free

He picked me up
Turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
Changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
I thank God

Get up, get up, get up
Get up out of that grave

He picked me up
Turned me around
Placed my feet on solid ground
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
Because He healed my heart
Changed my name
Forever free, I'm not the same
I thank the Master
I thank the Savior
I thank God
