You woke me up this morning
Yeah, my cup is overflowing
You have blessed me and I know it
So I owe You my praise

You're the author of my story
When I thought that it was over
But Your mercy kept me going
So I owe You my praise

Praises
Oh Lord, You deserve
Oh Lord, You deserve all my
Praises
Oh Lord, You deserve
Only You deserve all my praise

I know I'm far from finished
But Your grace is still sufficient
And that's what makes the difference
So I owe You my praise

Now I'm standing here forgiven
Knowing life is worth the living
You're the God of new beginnings
So I owe You my praise

Praises
Oh Lord, You deserve
Oh Lord, You deserve all my
Praises
Oh Lord, You deserve
Only You deserve all my praise

When I think of all You've done
When I think of all You've brought me through
When I think about Your love (hey)
I could never say enough Thank Yous

For the ways that You have made
For the price that You have paid
For Your mercies every day
That's why I owe You praise
