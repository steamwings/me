I won't bow to idols
I'll stand strong and worship You
And if it puts me in the fire
I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too

I won't be formed by feelings
I hold fast to what is true
If the cross brings transformation
Then I'll be crucified with You

'Cause death is just the doorway
Into resurrection life
And if I join You in Your suffering
Then I'll join You when You rise

And when You return in glory
With all the angels and the saints
My heart will still be singing
My song will be the same
