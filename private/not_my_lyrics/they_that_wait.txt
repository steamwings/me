They that wait on the Lord
Shall renew their strength
They shall mount up on wings just like an eagle at soar
They shall run and not be weary
They shall walk and never faint
They that wait on the Lord
And I say wait on the Lord

Hold on a little while longer
Here's what you got to do
Trust and believe my friend
He'll work it out for you
One thing you must remember
My God is able and He cares for you
He cares for you

Wait on the Lord and he will come through
Wait on the Lord He will answer you
Wait on the Lord and He won't be long
Wait on the Lord He's going to work for
