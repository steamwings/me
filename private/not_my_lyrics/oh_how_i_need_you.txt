Lord I find You in the seeking
Lord I find You in the doubt
And to know You is to love You
And to know so little else

I need You
Oh how I need You
Oh how I need You
Oh how I need You

Lord I find You in the morning
Lord I seek You everyday
Let my life be for Your glory
Woven in your threads of grace

I need You
Oh how I need You
Oh how I need You
Oh how I need You

Light glorous light
I will go where You shine
Break the dawn
Crack the skies
Make the way bright before me
In your light I will find all I need
All I need is You
