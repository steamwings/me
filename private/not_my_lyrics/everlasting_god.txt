The Lord is my light and salvation
Whom shall I fear?
Of whom shall I be afraid?
The Lord is my light and salvation
Whom shall I fear?
Of whom shall I be afraid?

I will wait on You
I will wait on You
I will trust in You
I will trust in You

We set our hope on You
We set our hope on Your love
We set our hope on the One who is the Everlasting God
You are the Everlasting God
You are the Everlasting
