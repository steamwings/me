There is a table
Filled with best food
Can you hear The Father calling
There's a seat just for you

And at this table
All is forgiven
Trade in your chains of bondage
For crowns of freedom

All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you

This is the table of new beginnings
These cups are full of love
And it's never ending

And at this table
There are no orphans
Just a loving Father
And His sons & daughters

All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you

All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table (come on, come on)
There is a place just for you

Leave your shame at the door
You won't need it anymore
Hold your head up high
This is the start of your new life

Leave your chains at the door
They can't hold you anymore
Hold your head up high
This is the start of your new life

All are welcome at the table
There is a place just for you
No condemnation at the table
There is a place just for you
There is a place just for you
