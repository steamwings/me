Your love is devoted
Like a ring of solid gold
Like a vow that is tested
Like a covenant of old

And Your love is enduring
Through the winter rain
And beyond the horizon
With mercy for today

Faithful you have been
And faithful you will be
You pledge yourself to me
And it's why I sing

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

You father the orphan
Your kindness makes us whole
And You shoulder our weakness
And your strength becomes our own

Now You're making me like you
Clothing me in white
Bringing beauty from ashes
For you will have your bride

Free of all her guilts
And rid of all her shame
And known by her true name
And it's why I sing

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips

You will be praised, you will be praised
With angels and saints we sing worthy are you, Lord
You will be praised, you will be praised
With angels and saints we sing worthy are you, Lord

Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
