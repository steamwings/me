What a joy to be dependent
What a joy my utter lack
That I must follow my good Shepherd
His fence and path and rod and staff

What a joy to know my limits
What a joy to walk by faith
I'm a child who is too small
My Father must permit my way

What a joy to be so needy
What a privilege to be poor
Since I must pray in every moment
And every day I need you more

What a joy to be so humbled
What a joy to be contrite
That I, a sinner, you would welcome
And for a sinner you would die

What a joy to bear this burden
Side by side with friends in Christ
To build a city that's eternal
To sow and reap what leads to life

What a joy to be contented
What a joy not fearing death
Lord, be praised in every moment
I'll trust beyond my final breath
