Your body broken
My body healed
Your trust forsaken
My hope is sealed
For blamelessness, you're scorned
In sin, I'm grace-adorned
O gentle Jesus
You bled for me

You came to darkness
To bring me light
You took on weakness
To give me might
You were made despicable
To make me beautiful
O gentle Jesus
You bled for me

You became least
To save the worst
You gave me a crown
And took my thorns
You came, Immanuel
To bring heaven where we dwell
O gentle Jesus
You bled for me

Though I have disowned your name
Though I pierced you in your side
By your suffering I am free
By your death I'm justified
King of love, crowned that night
I will follow with my life
Cuz you're making all things new
Yes you're making all things right

Your hands that formed me
Your hands that bled
Your scars remind me
You died my death instead
Healing declared for all
Engraved in Jesus' palms
Oh gentle Jesus
You bled for me
