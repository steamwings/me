Be my eyes
To see what is unseen
Observing your abundance, Father
You show that good lies deep in what you made
Without you there's no clarity
Without you life is scarcity
Be everything to me

Be my ears
To hear and love the truth
In which your Word rings true, My Teacher
You help me to discern what wisdom cries
Without you there's no sanity
Without you all is vanity
Be everything to me

Be my brain
To medidate on your ways
Admir'ng your work, O Ancient of Days
You stun my mind so I must sing your praise
Without you there's no grand design
Without you nothing stays in line
Be everything to me

Be my voice
To speak always in love
So set my tongue on fire, Spirit
You fill my mouth with words to heal the world
Without you all I say is void
But your word cannot be destroyed
Be everything to me

Be my arms
To take up my own cross
To do the work you plan, O Gardener
You make to prosper smallest seeds I sow
Without you I am weak and small
Without you I've no pow'r at all
Be everything to me

Be my feet
That crush the crouching snake
And trek to every people, my King
You are the spring within my every step
Without you no good news to bring
Without you what would blisters mean
Be everything to me
