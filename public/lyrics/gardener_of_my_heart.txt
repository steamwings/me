Oh gardener of my heart
I am your work of art
By your design, I'm beautiful

Oh gardener of my heart
You formed my every part
And you prune me to make me plentiful

Father, be glorified
By what I grow into
And as you abide
I will abide in you

Oh gardener of our hearts
You planned us from the start
And the good works you made us for

Oh gardener of our hearts
Though we know see in part
Together we grow into your temple

Father, be glorified
By what we grow into
And as you abide
We will abide in you

Jesus you're the true vine
By you, we will bear fruit
You are our source of life
We can do nothing apart from you

Your works are wonderful
I know it full well (x2)
You made us wonderful
I know it full well (x2)

Father, be glorified
By what we grow into
And as you abide
We will abide in you

Jesus you're the true vine
By you, we will bear fruit
You are our source of life
We can do nothing apart from you

Oh gardener of my heart
I am your work of art
By your design, I'm beautiful
