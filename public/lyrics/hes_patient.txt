Jesus, you knew pain
You knew hurt and suffering
Just the same
You endured so I'd be free
Oh what great grace!
That calls us each to bow the knee
There is hope
'Cuz we believe

To the Lord, a day is like a thousand years
And a thousand years are like a day
He is not slow to keep his promises
But he's patient, wishing all be saved

I've tasted and seen
O'er the years, you've stayed by me
As you gently repeat
"Leave your fear and wandering"
Oh what great grace!
That calls us each to better dreams
We do believe
Help our unbelief

To the Lord, a day is like a thousand years
And a thousand years are like a day
He is not slow to keep his promises
But he's patient, wishing all be saved

(Oh he's patient, he's patient, 
he's patient, wishing all be saved)

We will wait on the Lord a little longer
We know He always hears his sons and daughters
Even when the sun can't beat down any harder
We will wait on the Lord

To the Lord, a day is like a thousand years
And a thousand years are like a day
He is not slow to keep his promises
But he's patient, wishing all be saved

He's patient, wishing all repent of sinful ways
He's patient, wishing for each prodigal's embrace
He's patient, wishing all approach the throne of grace
He's patient, wishing all be saved
