How long? Will You turn your face away?
How long? Do you hear us when we pray?
On and on, still we walk this pilgrim way
How long?

How long 'til Your children find their rest?
How long 'til you draw them to your breast?
We go on, holding to your promises
How long?

'Til You wipe away the tears from every every
'Til we see our home descending from the sky
Do we wait in vain?
Jesus, give us hope again

How long 'til Your word will still the storm?
How long 'til You bear Your mighty arm?
How we groan 'til You snatch us from the thorns
How long?

'Til You wipe away the tears from every every
'Til we see our home descending from the sky
Do we wait in vain?
Jesus, give us hope again

How long? Sweet the dawn that ends the race
How long? Weak our hearts but strong our legs
Looking on, great that cloud of witnesses
How long?

'Til You wipe away the tears from every every
'Til we see our home descending from the sky
Do we wait in vain?
Jesus, give us hope again
