Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
Lord please
Hear my heart's cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far

For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King

Lord if I
Find favor in Your sight
Lord please
Hear my heart's cry
I'm desperately waiting
To be where You are
I'll cross the hottest desert
I'll travel near or far

For Your glory
I will do anything
Just to see You
To behold You as my King

I wanna be where You are
Gotta be where You are
I wanna be where You are
Gotta be where You are
