Here the strong serve the weak
The rich care for the poor
Here the greatest ones
Are the first ones to serve

The famed befriend the no one
The healthy tend the hurt
Those who were enemies
Are now sister and brother

The sovereign Son took the bitter cup
So upsidedown could become rightside up

We adore
Our glorious, humble savior
With twisted thorns
You were crowned our servant king
We overcome
Through lives laid down like yours, Lord (for we know)
Your kingdom comes
To restore everything

The thief works for other's needs
Murderer preaches in faith
For each one is redeemed
Before the throne of grace

The alien made family
The exile finds belonging
Every nation eats
At the table of the King

The sovereign Son took the bitter cup
So upsidedown could become rightside up

We adore
Our glorious, humble savior
With twisted thorns
You were crowned our servant king
We overcome
Through lives laid down like yours, Lord (for we know)
Your kingdom comes
To restore everything

Creation groans
Let freedom come
Let justice roll and
We'll shine like the sun
Mankind the fallen
Shall rise anew
The earth was rotten
But once again Eden blooms

We adore
Our glorious, humble savior
With twisted thorns
You were crowned our servant king
We overcome
Through lives laid down like yours, Lord (for we know)
Your kingdom comes
To restore everything
