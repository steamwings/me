Dishwasher, phone call, car horns
Daily cacophony disappears when my ears submerge
The deep drone and harmonic bellows greet me

The slow universe reverberates
The depths of the cosmos remind me of my place
But the warm encompassment rejects my presence
"Return!"

The terrible powers make my ears throb
After an immeasurable moment, I emerge
I welcome my cacophony
And take a clean towel
