_Simple food ideas for real life_

Usually you don't need Instagram-worthy meals, you just need some basic building blocks to plan, buy, and cook food. This list is a simple way to start your quick and dirty grocery list.

- These are intentionally vague so they can easily be changed up. Try using stuff you already have!
- Pretty much always add salt, pepper, and appropriate seasonings.
- Add meat as you please.
- You can always look up a real recipe for help.

### A Basic Meal

- Protein, chopped and [pan-seared](#pan-sear-any-protein) or [stewed](#ballpark-stewing-times): chicken, beef, mushrooms, tofu
- [Roasted](#roast-any-vegetable) vegetable: broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, brussels sprouts, etc.
- Starch: rice, (sweet) potatoes, bread

### A Salad of Possibilities

- Greens: lettuce, spinach, kale, arugula...
- Veggies: literally whatever you want, chopped
- Protein: [chicken](#pan-sear-any-protein), chickpeas, beans, etc.
- Dressing: olive oil + something, like balsamic vinegar or lemon juice
- Grain bed: quinoa, couscous, or rice
- Garnish: nuts, seeds, raisins, cheese, croutons, etc.

### Basic Pasta

- Garlic + Onion (chopped, then sauteed in oil)
- Jar of pasta sauce
- Pasta of choice (about half a box or else you'll need more sauce)
- Roasted, chopped vegetable (e.g. broccoli, spinach, zucchini)

### Basic Nachos

- Chips
- Mexican cheese mix (melted in microwave or oven)
- Can of black beans (drained, rinsed, and warmed up)
- Salsa
Spruce it up: avocado, green onions, black olives, [crema](#lime-crema-topping)...

### Basic Burritos

- Can of corn (drained)
- Can of black beans (drained)
- 1 cup cooked rice
- 2 roasted zucchini or bell peppers, seasoned with cumin, chili powder, etc.
- Half onion (chopped, quick-pickled with 15min in vinegar)
- Burrito-size tortillas
- Toppings: salsa, avocado, cheese, sour cream, [crema](#lime-crema-topping) etc.

> Note: For leftovers, keep the different ingredients in separate containers until you make the burrito.

### Lime crema topping

- Sour cream (or mayo)
- Fresh lime juice (lemon isn't bad either)
- Optional: cilantro, garlic powder, salt

### Basic Stir-fry

- Chopped carrots, broccoli, mushrooms, onion, garlic, etc.
- Soy sauce and/or preportioned jar of teriyaki sauce

### Basic Beef Stew

- 32+ oz broth (extra just-in-case never hurts)
- A dutch oven or big pot or slow cooker
- Stew meat (cheaper, tougher beef, usually sold pre-chopped)
- Carrots, onion, celery, garlic (powder)

Chop veggies and sautee onion and garlic until fragrant. Add in the meat and broth to cover it. [Stew](#ballpark-stewing-times) until tender. Put leftovers in the freezer.

### A Sandwich Plan

- Spread: mayo, mustard, pesto, etc.
- Protein: deli meat, hummus, tuna salad, egg salad, etc.
- Veggies: lettuce, tomato, banana peppers, cucumber, pickles, etc.

> Spending more on high quality bread or meat is always worth it if it means you aren't going out for lunch.

### Tuna Salad

- 1 can of tuna, drained
- \>= 1/4 cup mayo
- Chopped pickles (essential IMO but if it's not your thing, okay...)

> Eat with crackers, on bread, or on greens.

- tomatoes, diced
- vinegar! and olive oil
- optional: olives, feta cheese, red onion

### Mushroom Salad

### Fried rice

- Butter (preferably, but oil works)
- Soy sauce (a few tablespoons, to taste)
- 2-3 cups rice (already cooked, preferably chilled)
- Sesame oil (this is fairly important to finish it off)
- As you like: frozen peas, carrot, garlic
- Green onion, chopped
- 1-2 Eggs (scrambled and chopped)

> Turns out this is probably the least simple recipe here. But it's worth the effort every single time.

### Roast any vegetable

- Preheat oven to 400F/200C
- Chop it, douse in oil, salt, pepper on a baking sheet
- Roast until tender (~15 minutes)

- 2 hours at 325F/160C in the oven
