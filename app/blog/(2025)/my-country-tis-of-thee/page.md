Ok, here it is.

<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem;">

    My country 'tis of thee,
    soured still by slavery
    for Thee I grieve:
    land where my fathers pried
    bounty from native tribe,
    dressed in manifest lie
    this song still rings.

    My native country, thee,
    land of relentless fee,
    thy barons I fund;
    I love thy apps and ease,
    thy dear monopolies;
    on wide disparities
    rich grow rotund.

    No more do tyrants here
    fear threat when they appear
    with soiled hands!
    Free now nep'tism treads,
    mocking the patriot dead;
    blood of integr'ty shed
    by despot mand.

    Let music tame the breeze,
    soothe swelt'ring fewer trees
    in freedom's smog:
    let mortal brains awake
    (do not our breath forsake),
    strangles on science break;
    our Earth prolong.

    Our fathers’ God, to Thee,
    Arbiter of liberty
    To Thee we plead:
    Yet may our land be bright
    Burned up by holy light?
    Protect us from Thy smite.
    Great God, our need.

    My country, 'tis of thee,
    sweet land of liberty,
    of thee I sing:
    land where my fathers died,
    land of the pilgrims' pride,
    from every mountainside
    let freedom ring!

    My native country, thee,
    land of the noble free,
    thy name I love;
    I love thy rocks and rills,
    thy woods and templed hills;
    my heart with rapture thrills
    like that above.

    No more shall tyrants here
    with haughty steps appear,
    and soldier-bands;
    no more shall tyrants tread
    above the patriot dead –
    no more our blood be shed
    by alien hands.

    Let music swell the breeze,
    and ring from all the trees
    sweet freedom's song:
    let mortal tongues awake,
    let all that breathe partake;
    let rocks their silence break,
    the sound prolong.

    Our fathers’ God, to Thee,
    Author of liberty,
    To Thee we sing;
    Long may our land be bright
    With freedom’s holy light;
    Protect us by Thy might,
    Great God, our king.
