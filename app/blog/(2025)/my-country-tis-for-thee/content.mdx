In April, I started a rewrite of this poem. I don't remember precisely what prompted it to be fully honest.

Today, in a week of ICE intimidating our city, I saw this poem half-finished in my old notes app. I spent all evening finishing it.

Perhaps I will sing it someday. For now, please enjoy.

  My Country 'Tis for Thee
  _by Zander Weather_

  My country, 'tis for thee,
  Soured still by slavery,
  For thee I grieve:
  Land where my fathers pried
  Bounty from native tribe,
  Dressed in manifest lie;
  This song still rings.

  My native country, thee,
  Land of relentless fee,
  Thy barons I fund;
  I love thy apps and ease,
  Thy dear monopolies;
  On wide disparities
  Rich grow rotund.

  No more do tyrants here
  Fear threat when they appear
  With soiled hands!
  Freely nep'tism treads,
  Mocking the patriot dead;
  Blood of integr'ty shed
  By despot mand.

  Let music tame the breeze,
  Soothe swelt'ring fewer trees
  In freedom's smog:
  Let mortal brains awake
  (Do not our breath forsake),
  Strangles on science break;
  Our Earth prolong.

  Our fathers' God, to Thee,
  Arbiter of liberty
  To Thee we plead:
  Yet may our land be bright
  Burned up by holy light?
  Protect us from Thy smite.
  Great God, our need.

  My Country 'Tis of Thee
  _by Samuel Francis Smith_

  My country, 'tis of thee,
  Sweet land of liberty,
  Of thee I sing:
  Land where my fathers died,
  Land of the pilgrims' pride,
  From every mountainside
  Let freedom ring!

  My native country, thee,
  Land of the noble free,
  Thy name I love;
  I love thy rocks and rills,
  Thy woods and templed hills;
  My heart with rapture thrills
  Like that above.

  No more shall tyrants here
  With haughty steps appear,
  And soldier-bands;
  No more shall tyrants tread
  Above the patriot dead –
  No more our blood be shed
  By alien hands.

  Let music swell the breeze,
  And ring from all the trees
  Sweet freedom's song:
  Let mortal tongues awake,
  Let all that breathe partake;
  Let rocks their silence break,
  The sound prolong.

  Our fathers' God, to Thee,
  Author of liberty,
  To Thee we sing;
  Long may our land be bright
  With freedom's holy light;
  Protect us by Thy might,
  Great God, our king.
