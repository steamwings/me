In April, I started a rewrite of this poem. I don't remember precisely what prompted it to be fully honest.

Today, in a week of ICE intimidating our city, I saw this poem half-finished in my old notes app. I spent all evening finishing it.

Perhaps I will sing it someday. For now, please enjoy.

  My Country 'Tis for Thee
  _by Zander Weather_

  My country, 'tis for thee,
  soured still by slavery,
  for thee I grieve:
  land where my fathers pried
  bounty from native tribe,
  dressed in manifest lie
  this song still rings.

  My native country, thee,
  land of relentless fee,
  thy barons I fund;
  I love thy apps and ease,
  thy dear monopolies;
  on wide disparities
  rich grow rotund.

  No more do tyrants here
  fear threat when they appear
  with soiled hands!
  Freely nep'tism treads,
  mocking the patriot dead;
  blood of integr'ty shed
  by despot mand.

  Let music tame the breeze,
  soothe swelt'ring fewer trees
  in freedom's smog:
  let mortal brains awake
  (do not our breath forsake),
  strangles on science break;
  our Earth prolong.

  Our fathers' God, to Thee,
  Arbiter of liberty
  To Thee we plead:
  Yet may our land be bright
  Burned up by holy light?
  Protect us from Thy smite.
  Great God, our need.

  My Country 'Tis of Thee
  _by Samuel Francis Smith_

  My country, 'tis of thee,
  sweet land of liberty,
  of thee I sing:
  land where my fathers died,
  land of the pilgrims' pride,
  from every mountainside
  let freedom ring!

  My native country, thee,
  land of the noble free,
  thy name I love;
  I love thy rocks and rills,
  thy woods and templed hills;
  my heart with rapture thrills
  like that above.

  No more shall tyrants here
  with haughty steps appear,
  and soldier-bands;
  no more shall tyrants tread
  above the patriot dead –
  no more our blood be shed
  by alien hands.

  Let music swell the breeze,
  and ring from all the trees
  sweet freedom's song:
  let mortal tongues awake,
  let all that breathe partake;
  let rocks their silence break,
  the sound prolong.

  Our fathers' God, to Thee,
  Author of liberty,
  To Thee we sing;
  Long may our land be bright
  With freedom's holy light;
  Protect us by Thy might,
  Great God, our king.
